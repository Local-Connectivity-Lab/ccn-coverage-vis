# ccn-coverage-vis

Visualizations of coverage and performance analysis for Community Cellular Networks.

# Issues
- Graphical bug for Switch component
- Save tokens in session storage if not click on Remember Me
- Graph scales poorly on mobile devices. Adjust max width. 
- Change marker colors for different site status. e.g. planned/active
- Add AT&T/T mobile/Verizon coverage for testing and comparison. 

# TODOs
- Implement Generate QR Code UI and backend security
- Implement a UI to edit sites information
- Implement a page to manually import/export data.
- Add filters to only choose a range of data (already implemented on backend)
- Make the graph more informative.
